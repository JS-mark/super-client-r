## Project Overview

## Current State

This is a newly initialized repository with only:
- A README.md with project name and description

No source code, build configuration, or development tooling has been set up yet.

## Development Setup

The project has not yet established:
- Programming language (the "-r" suffix suggests Rust, but this is not confirmed)
- Build system
